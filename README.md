### Description
This is just my small, personal website. It serves the basic purpose of a modern business card.

### Environment
The Makefile is set up to make releasing easy.  You'll need some setup to get it to work:
- PORTFOLIO_SERVER_IP
    - Set this to the IP Address of the host server

### Setup
After configuring a new server, you'll need to run the make task to handle some configuration.
`make setup_server`

### Release
`make release_portfolio`
